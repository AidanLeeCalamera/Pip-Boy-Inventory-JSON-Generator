# Pip-Boy-Inventory-JSON-Generator
A HTML page for generating items.json files for my inventory patch for the Pip-Boy 3000 MK V.

## Usage
1. Download zip and extract to a folder.\
2. Run items-json-generator.html\
   Optional: If you have custom audio or images you want to add, select the DATA folder included.\
5. Select presets to add predefined items or add custom items with "Add New Item".\
   Optional: If making a custom item, select item type.
6. All stats are fully customizable by name, so you can name any stat whatever you want. Weapons have 6 damage types available.
7. Export the items.json by clicking "Export items.json", which can then be uploaded to the Pip-Boy 3000 MK V for use with the Pip-Boy inventory patch (coming soon) with the wonderful [Pip-Boy mainatanance tool](https://pip-boy.com/3000-mk-v/maintenance).
8. Stock up on Stimpaks and Radaway for the wasteland!


# Any PRs with custom items, whether from the games or just fun items you've made, are encouraged and welcome!
Simply modify the presets_x.js file relating to your item and add your custom item.
